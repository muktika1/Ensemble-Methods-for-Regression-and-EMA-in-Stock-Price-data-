# Ensemble-Methods-for-Regression-and-EMA-in-Stock-Price-data-

This project aims at testing out several types of ensemble methods for predicting stock prices. 
Optimized ensemble methods for stock price regression using EMA, Ridge Regression, and various techniques like Stacking and Bagging.
Explored synergies between EMA and machine learning models (XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest) to enhance predictive accuracy in financial temporal data analysis.
